## Summary
Bring back the MetaWeblogAPI for Version 9! MetaWeblog API is a programming interface that enables external programs to get and set the text and attributes of blog posts. The API uses the XML-RPC protocol for communication between client applications and the blog server.

## Description
MetaWeblog API integration enables bloggers to write their blog posts using an application like Open Live Writer or Microsoft Word on their local computer. Then it enables transfer of these blog posts to the Kentico CMS web application, either by publishing them directly on the live site or just saving them as a draft to be published later. Thanks to Richard Sustek from Kentico for his help with this project.
